# rustAnalysis
Does Rust really do what everyone claims it do?


# Plan

Using git projects to plan every weeks work. I am maintaining the To-Dos , In Progress and Done boards to track the project goals.

# Till Now Progress:

1. Rust: Many things are unstable in rust like its test and bencher crate so I can not find any solution to use them till now. 
2. I have made a basic hellow owrld testing enviroment for C and Rust. I am using C: clock() and Rust : Instant::now(). 
3. Another things to be pondered upon is precision . I am not getting very high precision in C unlike in Rust library for time keeping.

# Next :

1. Write *Native* Matrix Multiplication in both the languages.
2. Write *Sudoku* Benchmark on both the languages
3. Read what all are the graphs needed at end. time taken is one. What else?
